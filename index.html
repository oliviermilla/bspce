    <div data-controller="bspce">
        I received <input data-bspce-target="qty" type="number" min="1" /> BSPCE in <input type="number" min="2000" />
        with a Strike Price of <input type="number" min="0.01" />.
        I expect the company to go through <input type="number" min="0" /> new rounds and to keep growing at I received
        <input type="number" min="0.0" />% per year.
        Nevertheless, it is possible that we go under. I price that possibility at I received <input type="number"
            min="0.0" />%
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" onclick="" />
